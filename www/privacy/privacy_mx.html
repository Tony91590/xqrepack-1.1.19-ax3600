<h3>I. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT USED?</h3>
<br>
<p><b>(i) You must authorize us to collect and use your personal information</b></p>
<p>The purpose of collecting personal information is to provide services and/or products to you, and to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, regulations and other normative documents. You have the right to select whether or not to provide this information, however in most cases, should you not provide it, we may not be able to provide you with the appropriate services or respond to your issues. These functions include:</p>
<br>
<p><b>1.Functions necessary to manage and control the Mi router</b></p>
<p>（1） Mi Router configuration</p>
<p>In order to configure the Mi Router that provides you with Xiaomi Wi-Fi services, we may collect your Mi Account information, location information, device and account binding relationship, device identification information, configured Mi Router information and hardware and system information. Of which, your location information is used to obtain Wi-Fi info (Android 6.0 and above, must have location permission in order to obtain Wi-Fi info and Bluetooth use permissions) and determine the device’s connected server and default language. Configured Mi Router information will be used to confirm device type, activation and active status, determine the software functions included in the activation process, and identify the SSID used for binding with the device. Also for counting the number of device activation and activation. We will also use your aforementioned personal information in order to continue improving and optimizing the aforementioned functions.</p>
<p>The above various information types are listed in detail as follows:</p>
<p>· DEvice identification information: IMEI<i>OAID, MAC address, Android ID</i>IDFA and IP.</p>
<p>· Configured Mi Router information: Information related to your Mi Router. Includes Mi Router activation status, binding status, active status, sharing status, model, system version, MAC address, device SN, device ID, country code, and router location.</p>
<p>· Hardware and system information: LED light on<i>off status, USB 3.0 on</i>off status, default time zone, default date, default time, firmware version number and default language.</p>
<p>（2） Identify and display devices connected to the Mi Router</p>
<p>In order to provide management functions of the Mi Router, we may collect any or all information including network information, terminal device information, location information and hard drive information. Relevant Mi Router related information is used to identify the divice and provide corresponding functions and processes for every network device. For example, based on activation statusthe router will confirm whether to enter into initialization procedures; based on binding status, the router will confirm whether to bind with the Mi account; based on country code, the router will set the default time and language; and based on system version, the router will provide corresponding functions. Meanwhile, this portion of data may also be used for local router management and in-app displays of Xiaomi Wi-Fi, enabling you tomanage your network. Network SSID and encrypted passwords in the network information, as well as index information in the hard drive information may be used to provide remote access services. During remote access to your router, data may be transmitted via our servers to your device. Such data is encrypted and not stored on our servers.</p>
<p>The above various information types are listed in detail as follows:</p>
<p>· Network information: Information related to your network status. It includes network SSID, access mode, gateway address, upload and download speed of WAN port, encryption mode, Wi-Fi channel, non plaintext password, MU-MIMO on<i>off status, 2.4G/5G band on</i>off status and VPN configuration information (if the user has configured relevant information).</p>
<p>· Device information: Information of device connected to the network. Includes device connection status and timing, device name, IP address, MAC address, device type, device brand, connection type, signal strength, noise strength, upload and download speeds and throughput, maximum upload and download speeds, guest Wi-Fi ID information, guest network connect and disconnect time, operating system, device online duration and frequency of Wi-Fi connections made; in addition, bandwidth usage ratio and duration will be reported when the device exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
<p>· Location information: Information related to your location. Includes country code, GPS positioning (if granted permission), default time zone, default date, default time and default language.</p>
<p>· Hard disk information: if your Mi router is connected to a hard drive, or has a self-contained hard disk, we will collect information related to the hard drive. Includes a summary of stored files, specifically the total size, file count and index information. If you have activated the photo backup function (see below), we may also collect a summary of your backed up photo files, specifically the total size, photo count and index information.</p>
<p>（3） Push notifications</p>
<p>In order to provide push notifications for your Mi Router, we may collect your Mi Account, terminal device information, disk information and network information to provide you with message push services. Push services cover terminal device online alters, new software update alerts, backup behavior alert, channel switch alerts, permission sharing alerts, system error alerts, device report alerts and function recommendations.</p>
<p>（4） Application update</p>
<p>In order to allow you to continue enjoying Xiaomi Wi-Fi services, we will provide you with application updates. During this function, we may collect the router name and system version information to display to you the version information and update functions of the device.</p>
<p>（5） Firewall settings</p>
<p>We can provide you with firewall settings for your Mi Router. In order to use this function, we may collect your firewall level settings, network blacklist and whitelist and the MAC address of devices that have been blocked and experienced access failure, used to demonstrate the firewall effects and realize firewall functions. Please be assured that this information is stored locally on the Mi Router and will not be stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>（6） Wi-Fi speed testing and optimization:</p>
<p>We will read information such as download speeds, upload speeds, network delays, mobile network security status, Wi-Fi channel status, noise strength, channel throughput, download task status, upload status and signal strength. This information will be used to assess and display Wi-Fi quality, download status, upload status and signal strength. Please be assured that this information is read locally and will not be stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>（7） Quality of service (QoS):</p>
<p>We provide QoS functions. When you turn on the QoS functions, we may collect information such as bandwidth information, upload and download speeds, the type of speed limit you set (such as game priority) and the upload and download speed limit you set. This information will be used for intelligent speed distribution and speed limits.</p>
<p>（8） Regular visitor Wi-Fi:</p>
<p>We support the set-up of a Wi-Fi subnet that is specifically for visitors. If you set up visitor Wi-Fi, the supported device will connect to the subnet as a visitor, thereby distinguishing it from the primary network. In order to enable this function, we may collect the function on/off status, network SSID, encryption status, encrypted passwords and network terminal information that you have set. This information will be used to provide visitor Wi-Fi and network device display functions.</p>
<p>（9） Wi-Fi timer, scheduled reboot:</p>
<p>For better Xiaomi Wi-Fi service, we support setting Wi-Fi timer and scheduled reboot. When you turn on these functions, we may collect your Wi-Fi reboot time in order to enable you to set the Wi-Fi timer and/or reboot.</p>

<p>When this function is turned on, we will collect the sharing status and shared account information of your Mi Router, enabling users to provide you with sharing functions while also giving you the ability to control your sharing and view the sharing status of your router.</p>
<p>（13） Router backup:</p>
<p>When this function is turned on, we will upload your router configuration information to the cloud in order to back up your router configuration. Router configuration information uploaded to the cloud includes: Device model, MAC address, device SN, device country code, system version number, network SSID and password.</p>
